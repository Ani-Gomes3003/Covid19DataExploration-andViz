## Overview

This repository contains SQL queries and Tableau visualizations exploring COVID-19 data. The project aims to uncover insights into the pandemic's impact using data analysis and visualization.
## SQL Data Exploration Project

The (SQL_COVID_19datalorationproject.sqexpl) file contains a series of SQL queries designed to explore and analyze COVID-19 data. Each query addresses specific questions, providing insights into various aspects of the pandemic. Below is a brief overview of the queries included in the file:

1. **Q1: Total Cases vs Total Deaths**
   - Analyzes the likelihood of death if contracting COVID-19 in different countries.

2. **Q2: Total Cases vs Population**
   - Explores the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.

3. **Q3: Death Percentage in All Countries**
   - Displays the death percentage in all countries.

4. **Q4: Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population**
   - Identifies countries with the highest infection rate relative to their population.

5. **Q5: Countries with Highest Death Count per Population**
   - Highlights countries with the highest death count per population.

6. **Q6: Breaking Things Down by Continent**
   - Shows continents with the highest death count per population.

7. **Q7: Global Numbers**
   - Provides an overview of global cases, deaths, and the percentage of deaths.

8. **Q8: Total Population vs Vaccinations**
   - Shows the count of the population that has received at least one COVID vaccine.

9. **Q9: Using CTE to Perform Calculation on Partition By in Previous Query**
